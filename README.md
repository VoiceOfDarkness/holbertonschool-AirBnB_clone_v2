## About <a name = "about"></a> 🧐

This project presents a command-line interpreter designed for managing objects within an AirBnB-like application. Users can efficiently create, store, retrieve, update, and delete entities like users, states, cities, and places directly from their terminal.
The core of the project is a robust object-oriented structure featuring a parent class (BaseModel) that handles essential functionalities such as initialization and serialization. A streamlined serialization process allows the interpreter to seamlessly convert object instances to dictionaries, JSON strings, and ultimately to files for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### New Feature: DBStorage

This updated version introduces DBStorage, a new storage mechanism that leverages a MySQL database for persisting application data. By setting the environment variable `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db`, the application utilizes a `DBStorage` instance to interact with the database. This instance connects to the MySQL server using credentials and database information specified in environment variables (`HBNB_MYSQL_USER`, `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`, `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`, and `HBNB_MYSQL_DB`).
With DBStorage, any changes made to objects through the command-line interface are automatically reflected in the MySQL database, ensuring data persistence and consistency. SQLAlchemy facilitates connections and queries to the database.
Note: Before using DBStorage, ensure the relevant databases (`hbnb_dev_db` and `hbnb_test_db`) are created and configured on the MySQL server. The provided scripts (`setup_mysql_dev.sql` and `setup_mysql_test.sql`) can be used for this purpose.
This project serves as a crucial foundation for building a fully functional AirBnB clone web application. By establishing a solid groundwork with object classes, serialization mechanisms, and now database integration through DBStorage, future development phases like HTML/CSS templating, API development, and front-end implementation can be seamlessly built upon this base. Comprehensive unit tests continue to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application throughout its development lifecycle.
Ultimately, this project delivers a powerful and user-friendly tool for managing AirBnB-like data, paving the way for a smooth and immersive web experience for both hosts and guests.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a> 🏁

1.Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/VoiceOfDarkness/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone.git

```

2.run console.py

```
$ ./console.py
```

## Requirements 📃

No requirements needed on this stage of project :)

## Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a> 🔧

Unittests for the HolbertonBnB project are defined in the tests folder. To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:

```
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```

Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:

```
$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
```

## Usage of console <a name="usage"></a> 💻

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application (achieved by calls on the storage object defined above).

### Using the Console

The HolbertonBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file console.py at the command line.

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the file console.py by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```

To quit the console, enter the command quit, or input an EOF signal (ctrl-D).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```

### Console Commands

The HolbertonBnB console supports the following commands:

#### create

- Usage: `create <class>`
  Creates a new instance of a given class. The class' ID is printed and the instance is saved to the file `file.json`

![](https://github.com/VoiceOfDarkness/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone/blob/main/assets/create.gif?raw=true)

#### show

- Usage: show `<class> <id>` or `<class>.show(<id>)`
  Prints the string representation of a class instance based on a given id.

![](https://github.com/VoiceOfDarkness/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone/blob/main/assets/show.gif?raw=true)

#### destroy

- Usage: destroy `<class> <id>` or `<class>.destroy(<id>)`
  Deletes a class instance based on a given id.

![](https://github.com/VoiceOfDarkness/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone/blob/main/assets/destory.gif?raw=true)

#### all

- Usage: all or all `<class>` or `<class>.all()`
  Prints the string representations of all instances of a given class. If no class name is provided, the command prints all instances of every class.

![](https://github.com/VoiceOfDarkness/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone/blob/main/assets/all.gif?raw=true)

#### count

- Usage: count `<class>.count()`
  Retrieves the number of instances of a given class.

![](https://github.com/VoiceOfDarkness/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone/blob/main/assets/count.gif?raw=true)

#### update

- Usage: update `<class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"` or `<class name>.update(<id>, <dictionary representation>)`
  Updates a class instance based on a given id with a given key/value attribute pair or dictionary of attribute pairs. If update is called with a single key/value attribute pair, only "simple" attributes can be updated (ie. not id, created_at, and updated_at).
